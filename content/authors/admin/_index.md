Palas Kumar Farsoiya is an Assistant Professor at IIT Roorkee, where he leads research on multiphase flow physics at fluid interfaces. His work combines direct numerical simulations, theoretical modeling, and tabletop experiments to study wave–particle interactions, surfactant-modulated dynamics, and bio-inspired flow structures.

He is particularly interested in how emergent wave fields, interfacial chemistry, and multi-scale hydrodynamics give rise to complex collective behavior in fluids. His research addresses fundamental questions while building tools relevant to environmental and industrial multiphase systems.

He earned his PhD from IIT Bombay and was a postdoctoral researcher at Princeton University before joining IIT Roorkee.
